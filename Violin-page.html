          The violin i have is a 1946 french violin and its sound was deep and rich and i have played multiple concerts
          with this violin and it had been amazing what its capable of.
          My favorite place to perform is at Austria, Vienna's golden hall or known as musikverein. The rich sound is
          magnificient.
        </p>

          I was also lucky enough to perform in The Pantheon in Rome, Italy. A building still standing over 2000 years
          old.
          We were very fortunate to have Mastreo Maxim Eskenasky
          My favorite concert was the one in Vienna, Austria Musikveirn(The Golden Hall).
          It was my favorit because of the rich sound and the magnificient performance.
        </p>

          The violin has had a pretty big impact on me it has made me a better violin player and a better person and
          just enjoy what I'm doing. Doing this Spring season I bought a new violin case called Musafia and it's a
          handmade Italian case. It looks very cool and I love it, but the downside is it is pretty heavy and not
          convenient for traveling.

          I have been in Irvine Classical Players for over 2 and a half years and I have been studying violin with Dr.
          Popa in the time in the orchestra. A few things I like about Irvine classical players is that I get very
          unique opportunities while still having a solo even if you're not that good. For example, I went to Vienna
          Austria's Golden Hall (Musikverein) and I performed Czardas as my solo with my orchestra which has been in
          that time a very small orchestra with only 10 people. This orchestra has been very helpful to me and I have
          enjoyed it in the year 2024 I will be going to Nairobi, Kenya to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
          European Union and UK, England. I will be performing Zigunerwisen by Sarasate and moto perpetuo by paganini as
          my solos.

          recently i started the take priavte lessons with Cristian Fatu and had learned 2 peicies Mendelson Violin
          concerto 1st movement and mozart violin concerto no.3 with cadenza 1st movement. Besides learning peices i
          also learned how to play in a warm tone and rich and strong tone, which i both used in both concertos.
